# HOW TO MAKE A LOAD-OUT:
## slot 1: early game (such as brawler, ace pilot or electroshocker)
## slot 2: dps tower (such as turret, engineer, accelerator, pursuit)
## slot 3: sub-dps/support 1 (sometimes you need sub-dps in harder gamemodes, such as fallen, if you can win without sub-dps then procceed to get support) (sub-dps can be: ranger, warden, brawler, golden minigunner and militant) (support can be: commander, mercenary base, toxic gunner, warden, electroshocker, farm)
## slot 4: support 2 (such as: dj, mercenary base, toxic gunner, warden, electroshocker, farm)
