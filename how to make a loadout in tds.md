# HOW TO MAKE A LOAD-OUT:
## slot 1: early game (such as brawler, ace pilot or electroshocker)
## slot 2: dps tower (such as turret, engineer, accelerator, pursuit)
## slot 3: sub-dps/support 1 (sometimes you need sub-dps in harder gamemodes, such as fallen, if you can win without sub-dps then procceed to get support) (sub-dps can be: ranger, warden, brawler, golden minigunner and militant) (support can be: commander, mercenary base, toxic gunner, warden, electroshocker, farm)
## slot 4: support 2 (such as: dj, mercenary base, toxic gunner, warden, electroshocker, farm)
## slot 5: support 3 (such as: farm, mercenary baes, toxic gunner, warden, electroshocker, farm)

# RECOMMENDED LOAD-OUTS FOR EACH GAMEMODE:
### fallen: 1. ace pilot 2. gatling gun 3. ranger 4. commander 5. farm
## why its good:
### ace pilot:
- ace pilot is a good early tower game, best for early game
### gatling gun:
- gatling gun is the highest dps tower in the game, best for dps (helps with killing bosses and has piercing)
### ranger:
- ranger has the range of the whole map while also having good damage, best for sub dps (also helps to kill bosses)
### commander:
- boosts gatling gun, ranger and ace pilot for a bigger DPS
### farm:
- helps you get lvl 4 ace pilot for hidden detection on wave 10, and helps you max out everything
