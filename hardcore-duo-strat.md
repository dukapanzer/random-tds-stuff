# death reasons:
## shadow boss:
> player 1 didn't get 4 electroshockers in the front with level 4
> 
> player 1 didn't activate commander ability
>
> place 1 more lvl 3 militant in the back if you keep dying to them
## grave digger:
> a player skipped wave 34/35/36
## fast blue poops:
> call roblox admin to delete tds off roblox
